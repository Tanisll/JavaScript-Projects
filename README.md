# JavaScript-Projects
 
 This is a compilation  of all the JavaScript Projects I did while at The Tech Academy.

## Projects

* [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project)
* [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe)
* [Calculator](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Calculator)
* [To-Do App](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/todo_app)

I also did a few small experiments  using [AJAX](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/AJAX), [jQuery](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/jQuery), and [React](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/React_Projects). 

If you're interested in my learning process, you can take a look at my [Basic JavaScript Projects](https://github.com/Tanisll/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20JavaScript%20Projects) folder. Here I learned how to use: Expressions, Alerts, Functions, Math, Operators, Dictionaries, Comparisons, Types, Coercions, Ternary Operators, Constructors, Scopes, Time Function, String Methods, Countdown, Slideshows, Loops, and Arrays. These are very basic files. I was able to implement all of these features in my various projects. 

## Pizza Menu

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the
input information and caluclates a price for the order.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first
and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants
to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

## Calculator

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version
of a calculator.
